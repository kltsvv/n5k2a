                    Terry Davis was a man who really loved computers. He knew how to talk to them in a way most of us can't understand. He was born on December 15, 1969, and grew up at a time when computers were just starting to become popular in people's homes. Terry was so good at working with computers that he went to university and got a master's degree in electrical engineering.

                    But instead of getting a normal job like many people do after university, Terry wanted to make his own path. He had a big dream: to build his own computer system from scratch. And he did just that. He called it <a href="./templeos.html">TempleOS</a>. Terry said that God gave him the idea for this system. He wanted it to be a special place where he could talk to God. This might sound strange, but for Terry, it was very important.

                    He worked on <a href="./templeos.html">TempleOS</a> for many years, writing all the instructions for the computer himself. These instructions were written in a special computer language that Terry invented, which he named <a href="./holyc.html">HolyC</a>. The computer system looked simple with its black and white screen and simple graphics, but it was actually very complex and could do a lot of things.

                    Terry was not just dealing with computers. He also had a big challenge in his life. He had schizophrenia, which is a condition that makes it hard for a person to tell what's real and what's not. This made his life very hard sometimes. He would share his thoughts and feelings with people online, and sometimes these thoughts were very confusing or upsetting to others.

                    But even with these challenges, Terry kept working on his dream. He shared his work with the world on the internet. Some people didn't understand him, but others really admired how smart he was and how much he could do with computers.
